==========================

OpenJDK Assembly Exception
The OpenJDK source code made available by Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) at openjdk.java.net ("OpenJDK Code") is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html> version 2 only ("GPL2"), with the following clarification and special exception.

Linking this OpenJDK Code statically or dynamically with other code is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of GPL2 cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, Oracle gives you permission to link this OpenJDK Code with certain code licensed by Oracle as indicated at http://openjdk.java.net/legal/exception-modules-2007-05-08.html ("Designated Exception Modules") to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of the Designated Exception Modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under GPL2, provided that the Designated Exception Modules continue to be governed by the licenses under which they were offered by Oracle.

As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Oracle's GPL2 OpenJDK Code to build an executable that includes those portions of necessary code that Oracle could not provide under GPL2 (or that Oracle has provided under GPL2 with the Classpath exception). If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code, that new GPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception Modules if the new code is made subject to this exception by its copyright holder.
